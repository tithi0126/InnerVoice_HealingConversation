# Inner Voice: Healing Conversation

**Inner Voice** is a comprehensive mental health platform designed to support individuals emotionally while bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers. The system includes a mobile app for individuals and a web application for doctors and mental health professionals.

## Problem Statement

Mental health remains a stigmatized and under-addressed issue in India, with only around 10% of those affected seeking professional help. Socioeconomic stress, cultural taboos, and lack of awareness make it difficult for people to express their emotions or seek support.

Many existing apps fall short due to a lack of deep understanding and professional involvement. Inner Voice aims to address these challenges through a continuous, proactive, and holistic approach to mental health care.
